Resource-Oriented Architecture Patterns Books Examples

10/14/14 Update:

After being suitably hassled by Mssr. @jonflanders, I will issue another 
apology for the delay. I've been waiting for some other things to 
happen to make it easier to produce what I want to produce. Those
things have now happened, but I just need the time to put the
examples in place. I will commit to doing that in the next few
months.

I do apologize about the delay.
